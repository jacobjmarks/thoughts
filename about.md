![Portrait](/assets/me-round.png){:width="200"}

Hi üëã My name is Jacob.

I'm a Software Engineer currently working at [Azenix](http://azenix.com.au/).

With over 5 years of experience &mdash; both academic and professional &mdash; I've been exposed to a wide variety of technologies, programming languages and paradigms.

Since graduating from Queensland University of Technology in 2018 with First Class Honours, I have long since desired to return to the world of content creation; I found great pleasure in creating analytical and educational written content during my time both studying and working and the university as a Sessional Academic and I.T. Research Assistant.

This website is a personal project of mine in which I hope to share my thoughts and shine a light on a variety of software engineering tasks, topics and issues &mdash; including but not limited to the [Microsoft .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) space &mdash; to help educate others.

Thanks for visiting.
